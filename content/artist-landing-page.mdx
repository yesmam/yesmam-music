What happens when you combine a songwriter with over 20 years of writing experience, a drummer with over 30 years playing experience, a bassist with a love for all kinds of music who also plays the sax, and a singer with a voice that will remind you of the R&B singers from the 60’s. You get Yes M.A.M. We play mainly originals but we also do covers, but we do them the Yes M.A.M. way. Our unique mix of talent brings you a sound that is hard to describe. It’s a little jazzy, a little bluesy, a little country. There's one word to describe it, MUSIC. So listen in as four Middle Aged Men (M.A.M.) take you on a musical journey that spans a lifetime of love, heartbreak, and maybe a few bad choices. Yes M.A.M.
